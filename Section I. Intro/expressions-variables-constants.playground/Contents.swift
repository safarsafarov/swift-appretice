// Challenge 1:
//“Declare a constant Int called myAge and set it equal to your age. Also, declare an Int variable called dogs and set it equal to the number of dogs you own. Then imagine you bought a new puppy and increment the dogs variable by one.”

//var myAge: Int = 21
//var dogs: Int = 2
//var puppy: Int = 2
//var family = dogs + puppy

// Challenge 2:
// Give the following code:

//var age: Int = 21
//print(age)
//age = 30
//print(age)

// Challenge 3: Compute the answer
// Consider the following code:
//let x: Int = 46
//let y: Int = 10

// Work out what answer equals when you add the following lines of code:

//// 1
//let answer1: Int = (x * 100) + y
//// 2
//let answer2: Int = (x * 100) + (y * 100)
//// 3
//let answer3: Int = (x * 100) + (y / 10)

// Challenge 4: Add Parentheses
// Add as many parentheses to the followig calculation, ensuring that it doesn't change the result of the calculation

//var result = (8 - 4) * (2 + 6) / (3 * 4)

// Challenge 5: Average rating
//“Declare three constants called rating1, rating2 and rating3 of type Double and assign each a value. Calculate the average of the three and store the result in a constant named averageRating.”

//let rating1: Double = 23.4
//let rating2: Double = 54.2
//let rating3: Double = 74.5
//var answer = rating1 + rating2 + rating3 / 3


// Challenge 6: Eletrical Power
//“The power of an electrical appliance is calculated by multiplying the voltage by the current. Declare a constant named voltage of type Double and assign it a value. Then declare a constant called current of type Double and assign it a value. Finally, calculate the power of the electrical appliance you’ve just created, storing it in a constant called power of type Double.”

//let voltage: Double = 120
//let current: Double = 220
//let resistance: Double = voltage / current * 2
